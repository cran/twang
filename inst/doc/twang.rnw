\section{Introduction}

The Toolkit for Weighting and Analysis of Nonequivalent Groups,
\texttt{twang}, contains a set of functions and procedures to support
causal modeling of observational data through the estimation and
evaluation of propensity scores and associated weights. This package
was developed in 2004.  After extensive use, it received a major
update in 2012. This tutorial provides an introduction to \texttt{twang} 
and demonstrates its use through illustrative examples. 

The foundation to the methods supported by \texttt{twang} is the 
propensity score. The propensity score is the probability that a particular case would
be assigned or exposed to a treatment condition. Rosenbaum \& Rubin
(1983) showed that knowing the propensity score is sufficient to
separate the effect of a treatment on an outcome from observed confounding
factors that influence both treatment assignment and outcomes,
provided the necessary conditions hold. The propensity score has the
balancing property that given the propensity score the distribution
of features for the treatment cases is the same as that for the
control cases. While the treatment selection probabilities are
generally not known, good estimates of them can be effective at
diminishing or eliminating confounds between pretreatment group
differences and treatment outcomes in the estimation of treatment
effects.

There are now numerous propensity scoring methods in the literature.
They differ in how they estimate the propensity score (e.g. logistic
regression, CART), the target estimand (e.g. treatment effect on the
treated, population treatment effect), and how they utilize the
resulting estimated propensity scores (e.g. stratification,
matching, weighting, doubly robust estimators). We originally
developed the \texttt{twang} package with a particular process in
mind, namely, generalized boosted regression to estimate the propensity
scores and weighting of the comparison cases to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). 
However, we have updated the package to also meaningfully
handle the case where interest lies in using the population weights (e.g., weighting of comparison
and treatment cases to estimate the population average treatment effect, ATE). The main
workhorse of \texttt{twang} is the 
\texttt{ps()} function which implements generalized boosted regression
modeling to estimate the propensity scores. 
However, the
framework of the package is flexible enough to allow the user to use
propensity score estimates from other methods and 
%implement new
%\texttt{stop.method} objects 
to assess the usefulness of those
estimates for ensuring equivalence (or ``balance'') in the
pretreatment covariate distributions of treatment and control
groups using tools from the package. 
The same set of functions is also useful for other tasks
such as non-response weighting, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:nonresponse}.

The \texttt{twang} package aims to (i) compute from the data estimates of
the propensity scores which yield accurate causal effect estimates, (ii)
check the quality of the resulting propensity score weights by assessing 
whether or not they have the balancing properties that we expect in theory, 
and (iii) use them in computing treatment effect estimates. Users who are
more comfortable with SAS than R are encouraged to visit
\url{www.rand.org/statistics/twang/sas-tutorial.html} for information
SAS macros that implement these methods.

If you have not already done so, install \texttt{twang} by typing
\texttt{install.packages("twang")}. \texttt{twang} relies on other R
packages, especially \texttt{gbm},  \texttt{survey}, and
\texttt{lattice}. You may have
to run \texttt{install.packages()} for these as well if they are not
already installed. You will only need to do this step once. In the
future running \texttt{update.packages()} regularly will ensure that
you have the latest versions of the packages, including bug fixes
and new features.

To start using \texttt{twang}, first load the package. You will have
to do this step once for each R session that you run.  We also set the
seed of R's pseudo random number generator 
so that the results are exactly replicable. (There is a
stochastic element to the fitting of the propensity score models.)

To demonstrate the package we utilize data from Lalonde's National
Supported Work Demonstration analysis (Lalonde 1986, Dehejia \&
Wahba 1999, \url{http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/nswdata2.html}). This
dataset is provided with the \texttt{twang} package.

<<>>=
data(lalonde)
@

R can read data from many other sources. The manual ``R Data
Import/Export,'' available at
\url{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.pdf}, describes
that process in detail.

For the \texttt{lalonde} dataset, the variable \texttt{treat} is the
0/1 treatment indicator, 1 indicates ``treatment'' by being part of
the National Supported Work Demonstration and 0 indicates
``comparison'' cases drawn from the Current Population Survey. In
order to estimate a treatment effect for this demonstration program
that is unbiased by pretreatment group differences on other observed
covariates, we include these covariates in a propensity score model
of treatment assignment: age, education, black, Hispanic, having no
degree, married, earnings in 1974 (pretreatment), and earnings in
1975 (pretreatment). Note that we specify no outcome variables at
this time. The \texttt{ps()} function is the primary method in
\texttt{twang} for estimating propensity scores. This step is
computationally intensive and can take a few minutes.


<<>>=
ps.lalonde <- ps(treat ~ age + educ + black + hispan + nodegree +
                         married + re74 + re75,
                 data = lalonde,
                 n.trees=5000,
                 interaction.depth=2,
                 shrinkage=0.01,
                 perm.test.iters=0,
                 stop.method=c("es.mean","ks.max"),                 
                 estimand = "ATT",
                 verbose=FALSE)
@



The arguments to \texttt{ps()} require some discussion. The first
argument specifies a formula indicating that \texttt{treat} is the
0/1 treatment indicator and that the propensity score model should
predict \texttt{treat} from the eight covariates listed there
separated by ``+''. As when fitting linear models via the \texttt{lm()}
function, ``+'' does \emph{not} mean that these
variables are being summed; in contrast to the \texttt{lm()} function,
neither does it mean that the model is 
linear. This is just R's notation for including predictor 
variables in the model. There
is no need to specify interaction terms in the formula. There is
also no need --- and it can be counterproductive --- to create
indicator, or ``dummy coded,'' variables to represent categorical
covariates, provided the categorical variables are stored as a
\texttt{factor} or as \texttt{ordered} (see \texttt{help(factor)}
for more details).

The next argument, \texttt{data}, indicates the dataset.
\texttt{n.trees}, \texttt{interaction.depth}, and \texttt{shrinkage}
are parameters for the \texttt{gbm} model that \texttt{ps()}
computes and stores. The resulting \texttt{gbm} object describes a
family of candidate propensity score models indexed by the number of
GBM iterations from one to \texttt{n.trees}.
The argument \texttt{n.trees} is the maximum number of iterations
that \texttt{gbm} will run. \texttt{ps()} will issue a warning if
the estimated optimal number of iterations is too close to the bound
selected in this argument because it indicates that balance may
improve if more complex models (i.e., those with more trees) are
considered. The user should increase \texttt{n.trees} or decrease
\texttt{shrinkage} if this warning appears. The argument \texttt{interaction.depth} controls the level
of interactions allowed in the GBM.  The default is 3 and we typically use the default in our analyses. The GBM
estimation algorithm uses shrinkage to enhance the smoothness of resulting model. The \texttt{shrinkage} argument
controls the amount of shrinkage. Small values such as 0.005 or 0.001 yield smooth fits but require greater values of \texttt{n.trees}
to achieve adequate fits. Computational time increases inversely with \texttt{shrinkage} argument. Additional details on
\texttt{n.trees}, \texttt{interaction.depth}, and \texttt{shrinkage} can be found McCaffrey, Ridgeway, and Morral (2004).




\texttt{perm.test.iters} specifies whether $p$-values for KS
statistics should be calculated using Monte Carlo methods, which is
slow but can be accurate, or estimated using an analytic
approximation that is fast, but produces poor estimates in the
presence of many ties. If \texttt{perm.test.iters=0} is called, then
analytic approximations are used. If \texttt{perm.test.iters=500} is
called, then 500 Monte Carlo trials are run to establish the
reference distribution of KS statistics for each covariate. Higher
numbers of trials will produce more precise $p$-values. Specifying 
\texttt{permtestiters} greater than zero can greatly slow down
the \texttt{twang} computations. We tend to rely on the 
approximations (\texttt{permtestiters}=0) when using
\texttt{twang} in practice.

The \texttt{estimand} argument is used to indicate whether
the analyst is interested in estimating the average treatment effect
(ATE) or the average treatment effect on the
treated (ATT), as we do above.  ATE addresses the question of how
outcomes would differ if everyone in the sample were given the
treatment versus everyone being given the control (Wooldridge, 2002).
ATT, on the other hand, estimates the analogous quantity averaging
only over the subjects who were actually treated.  The
\texttt{estimand} argument was added to the 2012 revision of the
package which integrated ATE weighting into the package and the
\texttt{ps} function estimate of the propensity score.  


The \texttt{stop.method} argument %takes a \texttt{stop.method}
%object which contains 
specifies 
a set (or sets) of rules and measures for assessing the
balance, or equivalence, established on the pretreatment covariates
of the weighted treatment and control groups. 
The \texttt{ps}
function selects the optimal number of GBM iterations to minimize
the differences between the treatment and control groups as measured
by the rules of the given \texttt{stop.method} object.  
The package
includes four built-in 
\texttt{stop.method} objects. They are 
\texttt{es.mean}, \texttt{es.max}, \texttt{ks.mean}, and
\texttt{ks.max}.   
The four stopping rules are defined by two components:
a balance metric for covariates and rule for summarizing across
covariates.  The balance metric summarizes the difference between two
univariate distributions of a single pre-treatment variable (e.g.,
age).  The default stopping rules in \texttt{twang} use two balance
metrics: absolute standardized bias (also referred to as the absolute
standardized mean difference or the \textit{E}ffect \textit{S}ize) and
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic.  The stopping rule use two
different rules for summarizing across covariates: the mean of the
covariate balance metrics (``mean'') or the maximum of the balance
metrics (``max'').  The first piece of the stopping rule name
identifies the balance metric (ES or KS) and the second piece
specifies the method for summarizing across balance metrics.  For
instance, \texttt{es.mean} uses the effect
size or the absolute standardized bias and summarizes across variables
with the mean and the \texttt{ks.max} uses the KS statistics to assess
balances and summarizes using the maximum across variables and the
other two stopping rules use the remaining two combinations of balance
metrics and summary statistics.
The variable distributions used in the balance metrics depend on
whether we are interested 
in estimating the ATT or ATE, and correct specification of these
distributions is set automatically by the specification of the
\texttt{estimand} in the \texttt{ps()} function.


Having fit the \texttt{ps} object, the analyst should perform several
diagnostic checks before estimating the causal effect in question. The
first of these diagnostic checks makes sure that the 
specified value of \texttt{n.trees} allowed GBM to explore
sufficiently complicated models.  We can do this quickly with the
\texttt{plot()} function.\footnote{In versions 1.0.x of the \texttt{twang} package, the \texttt{ps}
function itself included some plotting functions.  This is no longer
the case (and the function no longer includes a \texttt{plots}
argument); these functions have been moved to the generic
\texttt{plot()} function.} 
As a default, the \texttt{plot()} function applied to a \texttt{ps}
object gives the balance measures as a function of the number
of iterations in the GBM algorithm, with higher iterations
corresponding to more complicated fitted models.  
In the example below, 
2127 
iterations minimized
 the average effect size difference and
1756 iterations minimized
the largest of the eight Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
statistics computed for the covariates. 
If it appears that additional iterations would be likely to result in
lower values of the balance statistic, \texttt{n.trees} should be
increased.  However, after a point, additional complexity typically makes
the balance worse, as in the example below.  
This figure also
gives information on how compatible two or more stopping rules are: if the
minima for multiple stopping rules under consideration are near one
another, the results should not be sensitive to which stopping rule
one uses for the final analysis.  
See Section~\ref{sec:pseval} for a discussion of these and other balance
measures.

%Each iteration adds complexity to the propensity score model giving
%it greater modeling flexibility. The increased flexibility improves
%the balance of the two groups up to a certain point after which
%additional iterations offer no improvement or actually make the
%balance worse. 




If we wish to focus on only one stopping rule, the plotting commands
also take a \texttt{subset} argument.

The \texttt{gbm} package has various tools for exploring the
relationship between the covariates and the treatment assignment
indicator if these are of interest. \texttt{summary()} computes the
relative influence of each variable for estimating the probability
of treatment assignment.  The gbm estimates depend on the number of
iterations at which the gbm model is evaluated, which is specified
by the \texttt{n.trees} argument in the \texttt{summary} method for
gbm.  In this example, we choose the number of iterations to be the
optimal number for minimizing the largest of the KS statistics.
This value can be found in the
\texttt{ps.lalonde\$desc\$ks.max.ATT\$n.trees}.
Figure~\ref{fig:relativeinfluence} shows the barchart of the
relative influence and is produced when \texttt{plot=TRUE} in the call to

\subsection{Assessing ``balance'' using balance tables}

Having estimated the propensity scores, \texttt{bal.table()} produces
a table that shows how well the resulting weights
succeed in manipulating the control group so that its weighted
pretreatment characteristics match, or balance, those of the
unweighted treatment group if \texttt{estimand = "ATT"} or the control
and treatment groups so that the weighted pretreatment characteristics
match, or balance, with one another if \texttt{estimand = "ATE"}.
By default, the \texttt{bal.table()} function uses the value of
\texttt{estimand} set with the \texttt{ps()} function call.  For example,
in the analysis we set \texttt{estimand =  "ATT"} when calling
\texttt{ps()} to estimate the propensity scores and the resulting
\texttt{ps.object}, \texttt{ps.lalonde}, contains an element ``estimand''
which takes the value \texttt{ "ATT"}.  The function \texttt{bal.table()} checks
this value and automatically uses ATT weights when checking balance and
comparing the distributions of pre-treatment variables for the
weighted control group with those from the unweighted treatment group.

\texttt{bal.table()} returns information on the pretreatment
covariates before and after weighting. The object is a list 
with named components, one for an unweighted analysis (named
\texttt{unw}) and one for each \texttt{stop.method} specified, here
\texttt{es.mean} and \texttt{ks.max}. McCaffrey et al
(2004) essentially used \texttt{es.mean} for the analyses, but
our more recent work has sometimes used \texttt{ks.max}. See
McCaffrey et al. (2013) for a more detailed description of these
choices.

If there are missing values (represented as \texttt{NA}) in
the covariates, \texttt{twang} will 
attempt to construct weights that also balance rates of 
missingness in the treatment and control arms.  In this case, the 
\texttt{bal.table()} will have an extra row for each variable that has
missing entries.  

The columns of the table consist of the following items:
\begin{description}
\item[tx.mn, ct.mn] The treatment means and the control means for each
  of the variables. The unweighted 
table (unw) shows the unweighted means.  For each stopping rule the
means are weighted using weights corresponding to the gbm model
selected by \texttt{ps()} using the stopping rule.  When \texttt{estimand =
  "ATT"} the weights for the treatment group always equal 1 for all
cases and 
there is no difference between unweighted and propensity
score weighted tx.mn.

\item[tx.sd, ct.sd] The propensity score weighted treatment and
  control groups' standard deviations for each of the variables. 
The unweighted table (unw) shows the unweighted
standard deviations

\item[std.eff.sz] The standardized effect size, defined as the
treatment group mean minus the control group mean divided by the
treatment group standard deviation if \texttt{estimand = "ATT"} or
divided by the pooled sample (treatment and control) standard
deviation if \texttt{estimand = "ATE"}. (In discussions of propensity
scores this value is sometimes referred to as ``standardized
bias''.) Occasionally, lack of treatment group or pooled sample 
variance on a
covariate results in very large (or infinite) standardized effect
sizes. For purposes of analyzing mean effect sizes across multiple
covariates, we set all standardized effect sizes larger
than 500 to \texttt{NA} (missing values).

\item[stat, p] Depending on whether the variable is continuous or
categorical, \texttt{stat} is a t-statistic or a $\chi^2$ statistic.
\texttt{p} is the associated p-value

\item[ks, ks.pval] The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic and its
associated p-value. P-values for the KS statistics are either
derived from Monte Carlo simulations or analytic approximations,
depending on the specifications made in the \texttt{perm.test.iters}
argument of the \texttt{ps} function. For categorical variables this
is just the $\chi^2$ test p-value
\end{description}

Components of these tables are useful for demonstrating that
pretreatment differences between groups on observed variables have
been eliminated using the weights. The
\texttt{xtable} package aids in formatting for \LaTeX { }and Word
documents. Table~\ref{tab:balance} shows the results for
\texttt{ks.max} reformatted for a \LaTeX { }document. For Word
documents, paste the \LaTeX { }description of the table into a Word
document, highlight it and use Word tools to convert the text to a
table using ``\&'' as the separator.  


<<results=tex>>=
library(xtable)
pretty.tab <- lalonde.balance$ks.max.ATT[,c("tx.mn","ct.mn","ks")]
pretty.tab <- cbind(pretty.tab, lalonde.balance$unw[,"ct.mn"])
names(pretty.tab) <- c("E(Y1|t=1)","E(Y0|t=1)","KS","E(Y0|t=0)")

       label = "tab:balance",
       digits = c(0, 2, 2, 2, 2),
       align=c("l","r","r","r","r"))
@

The \texttt{summary()} method for \texttt{ps} objects offers a
compact summary of the sample sizes of the groups and the balance
measures. If \texttt{perm.test.iters>0} was used to create the
\texttt{ps} object, then Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate
p-values for the maximum KS statistic that would be expected across
the covariates, had individuals with the same covariate values been
assigned to groups randomly. Thus, a p-value of 0.04 for
\texttt{max.ks.p} indicates that the largest KS statistic found
across the covariates is larger than would be expected in 96\% of
trials in which the same cases were randomly assigned to groups.

<<>>=
summary(ps.lalonde)
@


In general, weighted means can have greater sampling variance than
unweighted means from a sample of equal size. The effective sample
size (ESS) of the weighted comparison group captures this increase
in variance as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{ESS} = \frac{\left(\sum_{i\in C} w_i\right)^2}{\sum_{i\in C}
w_i^2}.
\label{eq:ESS}
\end{equation}

The ESS is approximately the number of observations from a simple
random sample that yields an estimate with sampling variation
equal to the sampling variation obtained with the weighted
comparison observations. Therefore, the ESS will give an estimate of
the number of comparison participants that are comparable to the
treatment group when \texttt{estimand = "ATT"}.  
The ESS is an accurate measure of the relative
size of the variance of means when the weights are fixed or they are
uncorrelated with outcomes. Otherwise the ESS underestimates the
effective sample size (Little \& Vartivarian, 2004). With propensity
score weights, it is rare that weights are uncorrelated with
outcomes.  Hence the ESS typically gives a lower bound on the effective
sample size, but it still serves as a useful measure for choosing
among alternative models and assessing the overall quality of a model,
even if it provides a possibly conservative picture of the loss in
precision due to weighting.  



The \texttt{ess.treat} and \texttt{ess.ctrl} columns in the summary
results shows the ESS for the 
estimated propensity scores. Note that although the original
comparison group had 429 cases, the
propensity score estimates effectively utilize only
23 or
27.1 of the comparison
cases, depending on the rules and measures used to estimate the
propensity scores. While this may seem like a large loss of sample
size, this indicates that many of the original cases were unlike the
treatment cases and, hence, were not useful for isolating the
treatment effect. Moreover, similar or even greater reductions in
ESS would be expected from alternative approaches to using
propensity scores, such as matching or stratification.
Since the estimand of interest in this example is ATT,
\texttt{ess.treat = n.treat} throughout (i.e., all treatment cases
have a weight of 1). 



\subsection{Graphical assessments of balance}
\label{sec:plots} 

The \texttt{plot()} function can generate useful
diagnostic plots from the propensity score objects. The full set of
plots available in \texttt{twang} and the argument value of
\texttt{plot} to produce each one are given in
Table~\ref{tab:allArg}.  
The convergence plot
--- the default --- was discussed above.  

The \texttt{plot()} function takes a \texttt{plots} argument in order to
produce other diagnostic plots.  For example, specifying \texttt{plots
  = 2} or \texttt{plots = "boxplot"}
produces boxplots illustrating the spread of the estimated
propensity scores in the treatment and comparison groups. Whereas
propensity score stratification requires considerable overlap in
these spreads, excellent covariate balance can often be achieved
with weights, even when the propensity scores
estimated for the treatment and control groups show little overlap.

The effect size plot illustrates the effect of weights on the
magnitude of differences between groups on each pretreatment
covariate. These magnitudes are standardized using the standardized
effect size described earlier.  In these plots, substantial
reductions in effect sizes are observed for most variables (blue
lines), with only one variable showing an increase in effect size
(red lines), but only a seemingly trivial increase. Closed red
circles indicate a statistically significant difference, many of
which occur before weighting, none after. In some analyses variables
can have very little variance in the treatment group sample or the
entire sample and group
differences can be very large relative to the standard
deviations. In these situations, the user is warned that some effect sizes
are too large to plot. 


\begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE,height=4,width=6>>=
plot(ps.lalonde, plots=3)
@
\end{center}

When many of the p-values testing individual covariates for balance are very small, the groups are clearly
imbalanced and inconsistent with what we would expect had the groups been formed by random assignment. After
weighting we would expect the p-values to be larger if balance had been achieved. We use a QQ plot comparing
the quantiles of the observed p-values to the quantiles of the uniform distribution (45 degree line) to conduct
this check of balance. Ideally, the p-values from independent tests in which the null hypothesis is true will
have a uniform distribution. Although the ideal is unlikely to hold even if we had random assignment (Bland, 2013),
severe deviation of the p-values below the diagonal suggests lack of balance and p-values running at or above the diagonal
suggests balance might have been achieved. The p-value plot (\texttt{plots}=4 or \texttt{plots="t"}) allows users to visually to inspect
the p-values of the t-tests for group differences in the covariate means.

\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lalonde, plots = 4)
@ 
\end{center}

Before weighting (closed circles), the groups have statistically
significant differences on many variables (i.e., p-values are near
zero). After weighting (open circles) the p-values are generally above the
45-degree line, which represents the cumulative distribution of a
uniform variable on [0,1]. This indicates that the p-values are even
larger than would be expected in a randomized study. 

One can inspect similar plots for the KS statistic with the argument
\texttt{plots = "ks"} or 

\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lalonde, plots = 5)
@ 
\end{center}


%\texttt{plot()}
%can create similar figures for KS statistic p-values by setting
%\texttt{plots="ks pvalues"}.

%\begin{center}
%<<fig=TRUE,height=4,width=6>>=
%plot(ps.lalonde, plots=5)

%\begin{figure}[h]
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics{twang-iterPt.pdf}
%  \caption{Caption.}
%\end{figure}
  
  

In all cases, the \texttt{subset} argument can be used if we wish to
fous on results from one stopping rule.  

\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lalonde, plots = 3, subset = 2)

\end{center}


\subsection{Analysis of outcomes}

A separate R package, the \texttt{survey} package, is useful for
performing the outcomes analyses using weights. Its
statistical methods account for the weights when computing
standard error estimates. It is not a part of the standard R
installation but installing \texttt{twang} should automatically
install \texttt{survey} as well.

<<>>=
library(survey)
@

The \texttt{get.weights()} function extracts the propensity score
weights from a \texttt{ps} object. Those weights may then be used as
case weights in a \texttt{svydesign} object.  By default, it returns
weights corresponding to the estimand (ATE or ATT) that was specified
in the original call to \texttt{ps()}.  If needed, the user can
override the default via the optional \texttt{estimand} argument. 



<<>>=
lalonde$w <- get.weights(ps.lalonde, stop.method="es.mean")
design.ps <- svydesign(ids=~1, weights=~w, data=lalonde)
@

<<echo=FALSE>>=
@ 


%The \texttt{estimand} argument to the \texttt{get.weights} function
%specifies whether the weights are for estimating the treatment
%effect on the treated (ATT), computed as 1 for the treatment cases and
%$p/(1-p)$ for the comparison cases, or for estimating the treatment
%effect on the population (ATE), computed as $1/p$ for the treatment cases
%and $1/(1-p)$ for the comparison cases. 
%The currently implemented
%\texttt{stop.method} objects optimize for the treatment effect on
%the treated and it is possible that a different set of propensity
%scores would be optimal for a treatment on the population analysis.
The \texttt{stop.method} argument specifies which GBM model, and
consequently which weights, to utilize.
%The third argument to \texttt{get.weights} selects which set of
%weights to utilize. 
%If no \texttt{stop.method} is selected then it
%returns the first set of weights.


The \texttt{svydesign} function from the \texttt{survey} package
creates an object that stores the dataset along with design
information needed for analyses. See \texttt{help(svydesign)} for
more details on setting up \texttt{svydesign} objects.

The aim of the National Supported Work Demonstration analysis is to
determine whether the program was effective at increasing earnings
in 1978. The propensity score adjusted test can be computed with
\texttt{svyglm}.



<<>>=
glm1 <- svyglm(re78 ~ treat, design=design.ps)
summary(glm1)
@



The analysis estimates an increase in earnings of
\$733 for those that participated in the
NSW compared with similarly situated people observed in the CPS. The
effect, however, does not appear to be statistically significant.


Some authors have recommended utilizing both propensity score
adjustment and additional covariate adjustment to minimize mean
square error or to obtain ``doubly robust'' estimates
of the treatment effect (Huppler-Hullsiek \& Louis 2002, Bang \&
Robins 2005). These estimators are consistent if either the
propensity scores are estimated correctly \textit{or} the regression
model is specified correctly. For example, note that the balance
table for \texttt{ks.max.ATT} made the two groups more similar on
\texttt{nodegree}, but still some differences remained,
70.8\% of the treatment
group had no degree while
60.1\% of the comparison
group had no degree. While linear regression is sensitive to model
misspecification when the treatment and comparison groups are
dissimilar, the propensity score weighting has made them more
similar, perhaps enough so that additional modeling with covariates
can adjust for any remaining differences. In addition to potential
bias reduction, the inclusion of additional covariates can reduce
the standard error of the treatment effect if some of the covariates
are strongly related to the outcome.

<<>>=
glm2 <- svyglm(re78 ~ treat + nodegree, design=design.ps)
summary(glm2)
@

Adjusting for the remaining group difference in the
\texttt{nodegree} variable slightly increased the estimate of the
program's effect to \$920, but the
difference is still not statistically significant. We can further
adjust for the other covariates, but that too in this case has
little effect on the estimated program effect.



<<>>=
glm3 <- svyglm(re78 ~ treat + age + educ + black + hispan + nodegree +
                      married + re74 + re75,
               design=design.ps)
summary(glm3)
@

\subsection{Estimating the program effect using linear regression}

The more traditional regression approach to estimating the program
effect would fit a linear model with a treatment indicator and
linear terms for each of the covariates.

<<>>=
glm4 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + age + educ + black + hispan + nodegree +
                  married + re74 + re75,
           data=lalonde)
summary(glm4)
@

<<echo=FALSE>>=
glm5 <- lm(sqrt(re78) ~ treat + age + educ + black + hispan + nodegree +
                        married + sqrt(re74) + sqrt(re75),
           data=lalonde)
@


This model estimates a rather strong treatment effect, estimating a
program effect of \$\Sexpr{round(coef(glm4)[2])} with a
p-value=\Sexpr{round(coef(summary(glm4))[2,4],3)}. Several
variations of this regression approach also estimate strong program
effects. For example using square root transforms on the earnings
variables yields a
p-value=\Sexpr{round(coef(summary(glm5))[2,4],3)}. These estimates,
however, are very sensitive to the model structure since the
treatment and control subjects differ greatly as seen in the
unweighted balance comparison (\$unw) from
\texttt{bal.table(ps.lalonde)}.


\subsection{Propensity scores estimated from logistic regression}

Propensity score analysis is intended to avoid problems associated
with the misspecification of covariate adjusted models of outcomes,
but the quality of the balance and the treatment effect estimates
can be sensitive to the method used to estimate the propensity
scores. Consider estimating the propensity scores using logistic
regression instead of \texttt{ps()}.

<<>>=
ps.logit <- glm(treat ~ age + educ + black + hispan + nodegree +
                        married + re74 + re75,
                data = lalonde,
                family = binomial)
lalonde$w.logit <- rep(1,nrow(lalonde))
lalonde$w.logit[lalonde$treat==0] <- exp(predict(ps.logit,subset(lalonde,treat==0)))
@

\texttt{predict()} for logistic regression model produces estimates
on the log-odds scale by default. Exponentiating those predictions
for the comparison subjects gives the ATT weights
$p/(1-p)$. \texttt{dx.wts()} from the \texttt{twang} package
diagnoses the balance for an arbitrary set of weights producing a
balance table.  This function requires the user to specify the
estimand argument in order to perform the appropriate calculations
relative to the target group on which we are drawing inferences.  



<<>>=
bal.logit <- dx.wts(x = lalonde$w.logit,
                    data=lalonde,
                    vars=c("age","educ","black","hispan","nodegree",
                      "married","re74","re75"),
                    treat.var="treat",
                    perm.test.iters=0, estimand = "ATT")
bal.logit
@ 


Applying the \texttt{bal.table()} function to this object returns a
variable-by-variable summary of balance, just like it did for the
\texttt{ps} object.  

<<>>=
bal.logit <- dx.wts(x = lalonde$w.logit,
                    data=lalonde,
                    vars=c("age","educ","black","hispan","nodegree",
                      "married","re74","re75"),
                    treat.var="treat",
                    perm.test.iters=0, estimand = "ATT")
bal.logit
@ 

For weights estimated with logistic regression, the
largest KS statistic was reduced from the unweighted sample's
largest KS of 0.64 to
0.31, which is still
quite a large KS statistic. Table~\ref{tab:balancelogit} shows the
details of the balance of the treatment and comparison groups. The
means of the two groups appear to be quite similar while the KS
statistic shows substantial differences in their distributions.

\section{An ATE example}


In the analysis of Section 2, we focused on estimating ATT for the
\texttt{lalonde} dataset.  In
this situation, the ATE is not of great substantive interest because
not all people who are offered entrance into the program could be
expected to take advantage of the opportunity.  Further, there is some
evidence that the treated subjects were 
drawn from a subset of the covariate space.  In particular, in an ATE
analysis, we see that we are unable to achieve balance,
especially for the ``black'' indicator.  

We now turn to an ATE analysis that is feasible and meaningful.  We
focus on the \texttt{lindner} dataset, which was included in the
\texttt{USPS} package (Obenchain 2011), and is now included in \texttt{twang} for
convenience.  A tutorial by Helmreich and Pruzek (2009; HP) for the
\texttt{PSAgraphics}  package also uses propensity scores to analyze a
portion of these data.  HP describe the data as
follows on p.\ 3 with our minor recodings in square braces: 
\begin{quote}
  The \texttt{lindner} data contain data on 996 patients treated at
  the Lindner Center, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati in 1997.  Patients
  received a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).  The data
  consists of 10 variables.  Two are outcomes:
  [\texttt{sixMonthSurvive}] ranges 
  over two values... depending on whether patients surved to
  six months post treatment [denoted by \texttt{TRUE}] or did not survive to six months [\texttt{FALSE}]...  Secondly,
  \texttt{cardbill} contains the costs in 1998 dollars for the first
  six months (or less if the patient did not survive) after
  treatment... The treatment variable is \texttt{abcix}, 
  where 0 indicates PCI treatment and 1 indicates standard PCI
  treatment and additional treatment in some form with abciximab.
  Covariates include \texttt{acutemi}, 1 indicating a recent acute
  myocardial infarction and 0 not; \texttt{ejecfrac} for the left
  ventricle ejection fraction, a percentage from 0 to 90;
  \texttt{ves1proc} giving the number of vessels (0 to 5) involved in
  the initial PCI; \texttt{stent} with 1 indicating coronary stent
  inserted, 0 not; \texttt{diabetic} where 1 indicates that the
  patient has been diagnosed with diabetes, 0 not; \texttt{height} in
  centimeters and \texttt{female} coding the sex of the patent, 1 for
  female, 0 for male.
\end{quote}

HP focus on \texttt{cardbill} --- the cost for the
first months after treatment  --- as their outcome of
interest.  However, since not all patients survived to six months, it
is not clear whether a lower value of \texttt{cardbill} is good or
not.  For this reason, we choose six-month survival
(\texttt{sixMonthSurvive}) as our outcome of interest.  

Ignoring pre-treatment variables, we see that \texttt{abcix} is
associated with lower rates of 6-month mortality:


<<>>=
data(lindner)
table(lindner$sixMonthSurvive, lindner$abcix)
chisq.test(table(lindner$sixMonthSurvive, lindner$abcix))
@ 

The question is whether this association is causal.  
If health care policies were to be made on the basis of these data,
we would wish to elicit expert opinion as to whether there are likely
to be other confounding pretreatment variables.  For this tutorial, we
simply follow HP in choosing the pre-treatment covariates.  
The \texttt{twang} model is fit as follows


<<>>=
set.seed(1)
ps.lindner <- ps(abcix ~ stent + height + female + diabetic + 
                 acutemi + ejecfrac + ves1proc, data = lindner,
                 verbose = FALSE, estimand = "ATE")
@ 



We set \texttt{estimand =  "ATE"} because we are interested in the
effects of abciximab on everyone in the population.  We do not specify the
stopping rules.  Consequently \texttt{ps()} uses the defaults:
\texttt{es.mean} and \texttt{ks.mean}.  
We then inspect pre- and post-weighting balance with the command


<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width=85)
@

<<>>=
bal.table(ps.lindner)
@

<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width = 60)
@ 


This balance table shows that \texttt{stent}, \texttt{acutemi},
and \texttt{ves1proc} were all significantly
imbalanced before weighting.  
After weighting (using either
\texttt{stop.method} considered)  we do not see problems in this
regard.  Examining \texttt{plot(ps.lindner, plots = x)} for \texttt{x}
running from 1 to 5 does not reveal problems, either.  In regard to
the optimize plot, we note that the scales of
the KS and ES statistics presented in the optimize plots are not
necessarily comparable.  The fact that the KS values are lower than
the ES values in the optimize plot does not suggest that the KS
stopping rule is finding superior models.  Each panel of the optimize
plot indicates the gbm model that minimizes each stopping rule.  The
panels should not be compared other than to compare the number of
iterations selected by each rule.  


\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lindner, plots = 1)
@ 
\end{center}

\pagebreak

\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lindner, plots = 2)
@ 
\end{center}


\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lindner, plots = 3)
@ 
\end{center}

\pagebreak

\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lindner, plots = 4)
@ 
\end{center}


\begin{center}
<<fig =TRUE, height=4, width = 6>>=
plot(ps.lindner, plots = 5)
@ 
\end{center}

From a call to 
\texttt{summary()}, we see that the \texttt{es.mean.ATE}
stopping rule results in a slightly higher ESS with comparable balance
measures, so we proceed with those weights.  
Also, we note that \texttt{ess.treat} is no longer equal to
\texttt{n.treat} since we are focusing on ATE rather than ATT.



<<>>=
summary(ps.lindner)
@ 


As before, we use the \texttt{survey} package to reweight our sample
and perform the analysis.

<<>>=
lindner$w <- get.weights(ps.lindner, stop.method = "es.mean")
design.ps <- svydesign(ids=~1, weights = ~w, data = lindner)
svychisq(~sixMonthSurvive + abcix, design = design.ps)
@ 

The reweighting does not diminish the association between the
treatment and the outcome.  Indeed, it is marginally more significant
after the reweighting.



\section{Non-response weights}
\label{sec:nonresponse}

The \texttt{twang} package was designed to estimate propensity score
weights for the evaluation of treatment effects in observational or
quasi-experimental studies.  However, we find that the package
includes functions and diagnostic tools that are highly valuable for
other applications, such as for generating and diagnosing
nonresponse weights for survey nonresponse or study attrition.  We
now present an example that uses the tools in \texttt{twang}.  This
example uses the subset of the US Sustaining Effects Study data
distributed with the HLM software (Bryk, Raudenbush, Congdon, 1996)
and also available in the R package \texttt{mlmRev}.  The data
include mathematics test scores for 1721 students in kindergarten to
fourth grade.  They also include student race (black, Hispanic,
or other), gender, an indicator for whether or not the student had
been retained in grade, the percent low income students at the
school, the school size, the percent of mobile students, the
students' grade-levels, student and school IDs, and grades converted
to year by centering.  The study analysis plans to analyze growth in
math achievement from grade 1 to grade 4 using only students with
complete data.  However, the students with complete data differ from
other students. To reduce bias that could potentially result from
excluding incomplete cases, our analysis plan is to weight complete
cases with nonresponse weights.

The goal of nonresponse weighting is to develop weights for the
respondents that make them look like the entire sample --- both the
respondents and nonrespondents. Since the respondents already look
like themselves, the hard part is to figure out how well each
respondent represents the nonrespondents. 
Nonresponse weights equal the reciprocal of the
probability of response and are applied only to respondents.  


Note that the the probability of response is equivalent to the propensity score if we
consider subjects with an observed outcome to be the ``treated''
group, and those with an unobserved outcome to be the ``controls''.
We wish to reweight the sample to make it equivalent to the population
from which the sample was drawn, so ATE weights are more appropriate
in this case.  Further, recall that the weights for the treated
subjects are $1/p$ in an ATE analysis.  Therefore we can reweight the
sample of respondents 
using the \texttt{get.weights()} function.



Before we can generate nonresponse weights, we need to prepare the
data using the following commands.
First we load the data.

<<>>=
data(egsingle)
@

Next we create a response indicator variable that we can merge onto the student by test score level data.
We want to include only students with scores from all of grades 1 to 4. The data include scores from 
kindergarten (grade = 0) to grade 5 with some students having multiple scores from the same grade.  First 
we keep the unique grades for each student:

<<>>=
tmp <- tapply(egsingle$grade, egsingle$childid, unique) 
@

Because students do not all have the same number of score,
\texttt{tapply()} returns a list with one element per student.  
Each element contains the unique set of grades observed for each
student. We now check for grades in 1 to 4: 

<<>>=
tmp <- lapply(tmp, function(x){return(x %in% 1:4)})
@

The list tmp now contains a boolean vector for each student, where ``TRUE'' indicates the grade 
took on a value in 1 to 4. The sum of this vector for each student determines how many of grades 1 to 4 
we observed for him or her. 

<<>>=
tmp <- lapply(tmp, sum)
@

A student is a respondent if he or she has scores from all four of grades 1 to 4 or if the value of \texttt{tmp} is 4.

<<>>=
tmp <- sapply(tmp, function(x){as.numeric(x == 4)})
@

We create a data frame of response indicators so we can merge them onto the test scores data:

<<>>=
tmp <- data.frame(tmp)
names(tmp) <- "resp"
tmp$childid <- row.names(tmp)
@

and merge this back to create a single data frame

<<>>=
egsingle <- merge(egsingle, tmp)
@


Because nonresponse is a student-level variable rather than a
student-by-year-level variable we create one record per student.

<<>>=
egsingle.one <-unique(egsingle[,-c(3:6)])
@

We also create a race variable

<<>>=
egsingle.one$race <- as.factor(race <- ifelse(egsingle.one$black==1, 1,
                                         ifelse(egsingle.one$hispanic==1, 2, 3)))
@

As discussed above, to use \texttt{ps()} to estimate nonresponse, we
need to let respondents be the treatment group by modeling an
indicator of response.

      stop.method=c("es.mean","ks.max"),
      n.trees=5000,
      verbose=FALSE,
      estimand = "ATE")
@

As in standard propensity score applications, we should check that
\texttt{n.trees} was set large enough, so that balance would seem not
to be improved if more complex models were considered. Recall that for
\texttt{es.mean.ATE} the measure is the average effect size 
difference between the two groups and for \texttt{ks.max.ATE} the
measure is the largest of the KS statistics.

\begin{center}

%The optimal number of iterations for gbm to minimize the maximum KS
%statistic is 3989 and the
%optimal number of iterations for gbm to minimize the average effect
%size is 3513.  The weights
%do an excellent job matching the distribution of the respondent
%group covariates to those of the nonrespondents as shown in
%Table~\ref{tab:balance2}.

By default the balance table generated by \texttt{ps()} compares 
the weighted treatment group (respondents) to the weighted comparison
group (nonresponders) -- both groups weighted to equal the overall 
population.  However, the  goal is to weight the respondents to match 
the population not to compare the weighted respondents and 
nonrespondents. The default balance table may be useful for 
evaluating the propensity scores, but it does not directly assess the 
quality of the weights for  balancing the weighted respondents with 
the overall population.

We can ``trick'' the \texttt{dx.wts()} function in the \texttt{twang}
package into making the desired comparison. We want to compare the 
weighted respondents to the unweighted full sample. When evaluating
ATT weights we compare the weighted comparison group with the unweighted
treatment group. If we apply \texttt{dx.wts()} to a data set where
the ``treatment'' group is the entire \texttt{esingle.one} sample
and the ``control'' group is the \texttt{esingle.one} respondents and
the weights equal one for every student in the pseudo-treatment group
and equal the weights from \texttt{ps()} for every student in the 
pseudo-control group, we can obtain the balance statistics we want.

We begin by setting up the data with the pseudo-treatment and control groups.
We add ATE weights from the ``ks.max'' stopping rule as our nonresponse 
weights.

<<>>=
egsingle.one$wgt <- get.weights(egsingle.ps, stop.method="ks.max")
@

We now stack the full sample and the respondents. The variable ``nr2''
is the pseudo-treatment indicator.  We set it equal to one for the 
full sample and 0 for the respondents. Similarly, ``wgt2'' is the 
pseudo-ATT weight which is set equal to one for the full sample and
equal to the nonresponse weights for the respondents.

<<>>=
egtmp <- rbind(data.frame(egsingle.one, nr2=1, wgt2=1), 
                data.frame(egsingle.one, nr2=0, wgt2=egsingle.one$wgt)[egsingle.one$resp==1,])
@

We now run \texttt{dx.wts()} to obtain the balance statistics.
Switching to ATT from ATE yields a warning that can be ignored in this case.

<<>>=
egdxwts <- dx.wts(x=egtmp$wgt2, 
                   data=egtmp, 
                   estimand="ATT", 
                   vars=c("race", "female", "size",  "lowinc",  "mobility"),

The balance is very good. We can use the weighted respondents
for analysis. We select only the records with an observed outcome.

\section{The details of \texttt{twang}}

\subsection{Propensity scores and weighting}

Propensity scores can be used to reweight
comparison cases so that the distribution of their features match
the distribution of features of the treatment cases, for ATT, or cases
from both treatment and control groups to match each other, for ATE 
(Rosenbaum 1987, Woold\-ridge 2002,
Hirano and Imbens 2001, McCaffrey \textit{et al.} 2004)
Let
$f(\mathbf{x}|t=1)$ be the distribution of features for the
treatment cases and $f(\mathbf{x}|t=0)$ be the distribution of
features for the comparison cases. If treatments were randomized
then we would expect these two distributions to be similar. When
they differ for ATT we will construct a weight, $w(\mathbf{x})$, so that
\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{x}|t=1) = w(\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{x}|t=0).
\label{eq:balance}
\end{equation}
For example, if $f(\mbox{age=65},\mbox{sex=F}|t=1) = 0.10$ and
$f(\mbox{age=65},\mbox{sex=F}|t=0) = 0.05$ (i.e. 10\% of the
treatment cases and 5\% of the comparison cases are 65 year old
females) then we need to give a weight of 2.0 to every 65 year old
female in the comparison group so that they have the same
representation as in the treatment group. More generally, we can
solve (\ref{eq:balance}) for $w(\mathbf{x})$ and apply Bayes Theorem
to the numerator and the denominator to give an expression for the
propensity score weight for comparison cases,
\begin{equation}
w(\mathbf{x})=K\frac{f(t=1|\mathbf{x})}{f(t=0|\mathbf{x})}
=K\frac{P(t=1|\mathbf{x})}{1-P(t=1|\mathbf{x})}, \label{eq:weight}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is a normalization constant that will cancel out in the
outcomes analysis. Equation (\ref{eq:weight}) indicates that if we
assign a weight to comparison case $i$ equal to the odds that a case
with features $\mathbf{x}_i$ would be exposed to the treatment, then
the distribution of their features would balance. Note that for
comparison cases with features that are atypical of treatment cases,
the propensity score $P(t=1|\mathbf{x})$ would be near 0 and would
produce a weight near 0. On the other hand, comparison cases with
features typical of the treatment cases would receive larger
weights.

For ATE, each group is weighted to match the population. The weight
must satisfy:
\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{x} | t =1) = w(\mathbf{x})f(\mathbf{x}), \mbox{ and}   
\label{eq:balance2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 f(\mathbf{x} | t=0) = w(\mathbf{x}) f(\mathbf{x}), \mbox{ and}
  \label{eq:balance3}
\end{equation}
Again using Bayes Theorem we obtain  $w(\mathbf{x}) \propto
1/f(t=1 | \mathbf{x})$ for the treatment group and $w(\mathbf{x}) \propto 1/
f(t = 0 | \mathbf{x} )$  for the control group.  


\subsection{Estimating the propensity score}

In randomized studies $P(t=1|\mathbf{x})$ is known and fixed in the
study design. In observational studies the propensity score is
unknown and must be estimated, but poor estimation of the propensity
scores can cause just as much of a problem for estimating treatment
effects as poor regression modeling of the outcome. Linear logistic
regression is the common method for estimating propensity scores,
and can suffice for many problems. Linear logistic regression for
propensity scores estimates the log-odds of a case being in the
treatment given $\mathbf{x}$ as

\begin{equation}
\log\frac{P(t=1|\mathbf{x})}{1-P(t=1|\mathbf{x})} = \beta'\mathbf{x}
\label{eq:logodds}
\end{equation}
Usually, $\beta$ is selected to maximize the logistic log-likelihood
\begin{equation}
\ell{\beta}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
t_i\beta'\mathbf{x}_i-\log\left(1+\exp(\beta'\mathbf{x}_i)\right)
\label{eq:loglikelihood}
\end{equation}

Maximizing (\ref{eq:loglikelihood}) provides the maximum likelihood
estimates of $\beta$. However, in an attempt to remove as much
confounding as possible, observational studies often record data on
a large number of potential confounders, many of which can be
correlated with one another. Standard methods for fitting logistic
regression models to such data with the iteratively reweighted least
squares algorithm can be statistically and numerically unstable. To
improve the propensity score estimates we might also wish to include
non-linear effects and interactions in $\mathbf{x}$. The inclusion
of such terms only increases the instability of the models.

One increasingly popular method for fitting models with numerous
correlated variables is the lasso (least absolute subset selection
and shrinkage operator) introduced in statistics in Tibshirani
(1996). For logistic regression, lasso estimation replaces
(\ref{eq:loglikelihood}) with a version that penalizes the absolute
magnitude of the coefficients

\begin{equation}
\ell{\beta}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n
t_i\beta'\mathbf{x}_i-\log\left(1+\exp(\beta'\mathbf{x}_i)\right) -
\lambda\sum_{j=1}^J|\beta_j| \label{eq:lasso}
\end{equation}

The second term on the right-hand side of the equation is the
penalty term since it decreases the overall of $\ell{\beta}$ when
there are coefficient that are large in absolute value.  Setting
$\lambda=0$ returns the standard (and potentially unstable) logistic
regression estimates of $\beta$. Setting $\lambda$ to be very large
essentially forces all of the $\beta_j$ to be equal to 0 (the
penalty excludes $\beta_0$). For a fixed value of $\lambda$ the
estimated $\hat\beta$ can have many coefficients exactly equal to 0,
not just extremely small but precisely 0, and only the most powerful
predictors of $t$ will be non-zero. As a result the absolute penalty
operates as a variable selection penalty. In practice, if we have
several predictors of $t$ that are highly correlated with each
other, the lasso tends to include all of them in the model, shrink
their coefficients toward 0, and produce a predictive model that
utilizes all of the information in the covariates, producing a model
with greater out-of-sample predictive performance than models fit
using variable subset selection methods.

Our aim is to include as covariates all piecewise constant functions
of the potential confounders and their interactions. That is, in
$\mathbf{x}$ we will include indicator functions for continuous
variables like $I(\mbox{age}<15), I(\mbox{age}<16), \ldots,
I(\mbox{age}<90)$, etc., for categorical variables like
$I(\mbox{sex}=\mbox{male}), I(\mbox{prior MI}=\mbox{TRUE})$, and
interactions among them like $I(\mbox{age}<16)I(\mbox{sex} =
\mbox{male})I(\mbox{prior MI}=\mbox{TRUE})$. This collection of
basis functions spans a plausible set of propensity score functions,
are computationally efficient, and are flat at the extremes of
$\mathbf{x}$ reducing the likelihood of propensity score estimates
near 0 and 1 that can occur with linear basis functions of
$\mathbf{x}$. Theoretically with the lasso we can estimate the model
in (\ref{eq:lasso}), selecting a $\lambda$ small enough so that it
will eliminate most of the irrelevant terms and yield a sparse model
with only the most important main effects and interactions. Boosting
(Friedman 2001, 2003, Ridgeway 1999) effectively implements this
strategy using a computationally efficient method that Efron
\textit{et al.} (2004) showed is equivalent to optimizing
(\ref{eq:lasso}). With boosting it is possible to maximize
(\ref{eq:lasso}) for a range of values of $\lambda$ with no
additional computational effort than for a specific value of
$\lambda$. We use boosted logistic regression as implemented in the
generalized boosted modeling (\texttt{gbm}) package in R (Ridgeway 2005).

\subsection{Evaluating the weights}
\label{sec:pseval} As with regression analyses, propensity score
methods cannot adjust for unmeasured covariates that are
uncorrelated with the observed covariates. Nonetheless, the quality
of the adjustment for the observed covariates achieved by propensity
score weighting is easy to evaluate. The estimated propensity score
weights should equalize the distributions of the cases' features as
in (\ref{eq:balance}). This implies that weighted statistics of the
covariates of the comparison group should equal the same statistics
for the treatment group. For example, the weighted average of the
age of comparison cases should equal the average age of the
treatment cases. To assess the quality of the propensity score
weights one could compare a variety of statistics such as means,
medians, variances, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics for each
covariate as well as interactions. The \texttt{twang} package
provides both the standardized effect sizes and KS statistics and
p-values testing for differences in the means and distributions of
the covariates for analysts to use in assessing balance.





\subsection{Analysis of outcomes}

With propensity score analyses the final outcomes analysis is
generally straightforward, while the propensity score estimation may
require complex modeling. Once we have weights that
equalize the distribution of features of treatment and control
cases by reweighting. For ATT, we give each treatment case a 
weight of 1 and each comparison
case a weight $w_i = p(\mathbf{x}_i)/(1 - p(\mathbf{x}_i))$. To
estimate the ATE, we give control cases weight $w_i =
1/p(\mathbf{x}_i)$ and we give the treatment cases $w_i =
1/(1-p(\mathbf{x}_i))$.  We then
estimate the treatment effect estimate with a weighted regression
model that contains only a treatment indicator. No additional
covariates are needed if the weights account for
differences in $\mathbf{x}$.

A combination of propensity score weighting and covariate adjustment
can be useful for several reasons. First, the propensity scores may
not have been able to completely balance all of the covariates. The
inclusion of these covariates in addition to the treatment indicator
in a weighted regression model may correct this if the imbalance is
relatively small. Second, in addition to exposure, the relationship
between some of the covariates and the outcome may also be of
interest. Their inclusion can provide coefficients that can estimate
the direction and magnitude of the relationship. Third, as with
randomized trials, stratifying on covariates that are highly
correlated with the outcome can improve the precision of estimates.
Lastly, the some treatment effect estimators that utilize an
outcomes regression model and propensity scores are ``doubly
robust'' in the sense that if either the propensity score model is
correct or the regression model is correct then the treatment effect
estimator will be unbiased (Bang \& Robins 2005).
